# E-Commerce Backend

## Description
This project involved building an e-commerce back end by developing an Express.js API and configuring it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. I had to define the models for the seed information. Then create GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for the category routes, product routes, and tag routes. I had an issue with SQL when trying to 'npm run seed' saying my access was denied. I am working torwards fixing this error. It is very close to working I just need to resolve that issue.
